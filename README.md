# Lunar Lander: Deep Reinforcement Learning Project

This project is a deep dive into the world of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), using a virtual Lunar Lander as a practical application. The goal of the project is to train a Lunar Lander to successfully land on the moon's surface.

## Project Overview

The Lunar Lander game is a classic reinforcement learning problem. The agent must learn to control its movements and successfully land the lunar module on the moon's surface. The agent receives rewards for successful landings and penalties for crashes, which it uses to learn the optimal policy for landing.

In this project, we use DRL to train our agent. DRL combines deep learning and reinforcement learning, where the agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment.

## Implementation

The code for this project is implemented in Python, using the OpenAI Gym's LunarLander-v2 environment. The DRL agent is trained using a combination of techniques from the field of deep learning and reinforcement learning.

## Results

At the end of the code, you'll find a video of the Lunar Lander in action. You can see for yourself whether the agent has learned to successfully land on the moon's surface!

Here is a [clip](videos/lunar_lander.mp4) of the Lunar Lander in action.

## How to Run the Code

This project is best run on a Jupyter Notebook environment like Google Colab or an equivalent platform that provides sufficient computational resources (CPU/GPU). To run the code, you'll need to have Python installed, along with the OpenAI Gym and any necessary dependencies. Once you have these installed, you can upload the notebook to your preferred Jupyter Notebook environment and run the code there.

## Conclusion

This project was a great opportunity to practice and apply concepts in deep reinforcement learning. It's fascinating to see the agent learn and improve over time, and it's a great demonstration of the power of DRL.
